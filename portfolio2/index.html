        <p>Spotlight: Cory Suida</p> After completing my Psychology classes at Kutztown University while working as the full time executive mananager at Lehigh Valley's ultra-sleek Paxos Restaurants group, earning 3 differnet general manager positions over the ten-year committment and finally assistant director under genious director of operations I was being prepared to run multiple locations some with staff sizes in excess of 100 employees.  Naturually gravitating to all matters front of house and paradoxically those related to back-house technology, I began considering my natural tendancy to lean towards technology as a possible career-direction. It wasn't until my return home from a volunteer mission in Quito, Ecuador that I firmly made a commitment to break into the industry by any means availble. <p></p>
       <br><p>Entreprenuerial tendencies tethered to passion and ...to measure and study human behavior integreated with technology and just plain luck have afforded me the opportunity to begin studying Web Development technology at Triology's bootcamp program held at Univesity of Pennsylvania, graduation expected in May 2020. </p><br>
